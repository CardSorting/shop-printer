## Current Verified State

- **Transactional Hardening Verified**: Finalized production-grade transactional atomicity for the commerce engine. Implemented atomic discount usage decrements during cancellations and refunds. Transitioned all critical inventory and order logic to strict transactional point-reads (`t.get`).
- **Idempotency Hardening Verified**: Strengthened distributed order creation via a dedicated idempotency mapping collection and atomic payment-intent tracking in `OrderService`.
- **Refund Orchestration Verified**: `RefundService` now includes direct `discountRepo` injection, ensuring ACID-compliant integrity across all lifecycle state transitions.
- **Support CRM Industrialization Verified**: Full-stack ticketing system implemented with `AdminTicketDetail.tsx` and `AdminTickets.tsx`. Real-time agent collision (heartbeat) prevents response overlap. Quick Reply macros and internal notes are fully functional.
- **Digital Fulfillment Pipeline Verified**: Memory-efficient, streaming-first ingestion architecture deployed. Digital Locker UI implemented in `DigitalLibraryPage.tsx` for secure, authenticated asset access.
- **SEO & Navigation Hardening Verified**: Canonical handle-based routing active for `/products/[handle]` and `/collections/[slug]`. Automated `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts` orchestration implemented. JSON-LD structured data injected.
- **Concierge & Operational Intelligence Verified**: Production-grade support desk with triage intelligence and outcome tracking. Automated "Operational Digest" generates natural-language business insights. Team collaboration (assignment, activity feed) and customer continuity (session syncing) are fully functional and ground-truth verified.
- **Concierge Lifecycle Marketing Verified**: Autonomous lifecycle campaign strategy documented for welcome, cart recovery, browse assist, post-purchase care, review/referral, replenishment, win-back, VIP loyalty, and sunset suppression. Concierge tools now support customer investigation, lifecycle planning, playbook drafting, activation, optimization, enrollment, and suppression governance.
- **Framework/Runtime Stack**: Next.js `15.0.5`, React `18.3.1`, TypeScript `6.0.2`, ESLint `10.2.1`, Tailwind CSS `4.2.4`.
- **Persistence Layer**: Google Cloud Firestore (Distributed NoSQL).
- **Security Configuration**: Signed HTTP-only session cookies with HMAC-SHA256 signatures and production `SESSION_SECRET` length enforcement.
- **API Boundary Hardening**: Lightweight mutation throttling (rate-limiting) implemented in `apiGuards.ts`. Mutation-origin policy enforces same-origin for `POST/PUT/DELETE` requests.

## Physical Verification Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

Latest verification for the Transactional Hardening pass: `npm run test:e2e` completed successfully, validating atomic order management pathways and discount limit enforcement.
