# Digital Fulfillment & Asset Management

WoodBine implements a "Digital Vault" for secure distribution and management of purchased digital products.

## The "Digital Vault" Architecture

### 1. Streaming-First Ingestion
To support massive file uploads without exhausting server memory, the ingestion pipeline utilizes a streaming architecture:
- **Chunked Processing**: Large assets are processed in small, memory-safe chunks.
- **Concurrent Validation**: Checksums and file integrity are verified in real-time during the stream.
- **Backpressure Handling**: The system manages flow control to ensure stability under load.

### 2. Digital Locker (Customer Side)
- **Unified Access**: Customers view all their digital ownership rights in a dedicated "Digital Locker" tab in their account.
- **Secure Links**: Download links are ephemeral and authenticated, preventing unauthorized sharing or scraping.
- **Version Tracking**: If a merchant updates a digital asset, customers can access the latest version automatically.

### 3. Merchant Asset Manager (Admin Side)
- **High-Fidelity Feedback**: Real-time progress tracking for uploads and processing.
- **Atomic Operations**: Asset updates are atomic—shoppers never encounter a partially updated or broken file.
- **Access Auditing**: Merchants can track who downloaded what and when, providing a full audit trail for digital fulfillment.

## Technical Implementation

- **Storage Strategy**: Pluggable storage adapters (Local Filesystem, S3, or Cloud Storage) with a consistent core interface.
- **Security**: Authenticated download routes issue ephemeral access through server-side checks and digital-access records.
- **Performance**: Zero-copy streaming where possible to minimize CPU overhead during delivery.
