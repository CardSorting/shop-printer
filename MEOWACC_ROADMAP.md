# ShopMore: Open Source Ecommerce Platform (Audit & Roadmap)

> **Documentation:** Product and architecture docs live in [docs/index.md](docs/index.md). This file tracks strategic roadmap items.

ShopMore / **DreamBees Art** is an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Shopify — a neutral, high-performance commerce platform with full source access.

## 1. The "Neutrality" Wedge (Design Philosophy)

To serve as a generic base for any industry (from TCG to Apparel to Digital Goods), ShopMore embraces a **"Design-Less" Design System**.

*   **Aesthetic Neutrality**: Utilizing a refined, professional, and high-contrast UI that feels premium out-of-the-box but acts as a blank canvas for merchant branding.
*   **Standardized Taxonomy**: Adopting industry-standard terminology (Products, Orders, Customers) to ensure instant familiarity for users migrating from Shopify or BigCommerce.

## 2. The Customization Engine (Deep Audit)

The true power of ShopMore lies in its **Extensibility Substrate**.

### A. Metafields & Custom Attributes
*   **Wedge**: Implementing a "Dynamic Attribute" system where merchants can define custom fields (e.g., 'Size', 'Color', 'Material', or 'Grade') without modifying the database schema.
*   **Status**: Firestore-backed `metafields` are now supported across the Product and Order models.

### B. Modular UI Components
*   **Wedge**: Moving toward a "Slot-based" architecture where merchants can swap out product cards, checkout flows, and headers via a simple configuration layer.

### C. Developer Sovereignty (The "Source" Wedge)
*   **Headless-First**: Ensuring every action in the admin is backed by a clean, documented API.
*   **Transactional Substrate**: Transitioned from SQLite to **Firestore** for distributed scalability while maintaining absolute transactional atomicity.

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Neutralization & Standardization (Completed)
*   [x] **Terminology Clean-up**: Refactored all TCG-specific references to generic Product metadata.
*   [x] **Navigation Re-Architecture**: Implemented the "Approachable Merchant Layout" (Sales, Orders, Products, Customers, Content, Insights, Apps).
*   [x] **Global Search Hardening**: Finalized the `SearchCommandPalette` as a universal discovery tool.
*   [x] **Visual Sovereignty**: Transitioned branding to "ShopMore" with a neutral, high-performance UI.

### Phase 2: Industrialization & Extensibility (Completed)
*   [x] **SEO Hardening**: Transitioned to handle-based routing (`/products/[handle]`) with JSON-LD and Sitemap/Robots automation.
*   [x] **Support CRM**: Deployed a professional ticketing system with macros, agent collision, and knowledgebase routing.
*   [x] **Digital Fulfillment**: Implemented streaming-first ingestion and a secure digital locker for asset delivery.
*   [x] **Transactional Hardening**: Finalized production-grade atomicity for the commerce pipeline (checkout, cart, and refunds).
*   [x] **Idempotency**: Atomic payment-intent tracking and idempotency mapping collections deployed.

### Phase 3: Merchant Onboarding & Scalability (In Progress)
*   [ ] **Setup Guide 2.0**: A step-by-step interactive wizard for non-technical users to launch their first store.
*   [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Hardening the bulk editor for high-volume inventory management.
*   [ ] **Webhook Hooks**: Designing the service layer to support "Hooks" where external scripts can intercept events (e.g., `onOrderCreated`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Audit Note**: The engine has successfully transitioned to a Firestore-backed substrate, resolving previous SQLite concurrency limitations while preserving Clean Architecture isolation.
